# dynamic_population_model
In this repo, I employ a mean field (MF) approximation to analyze a model for population dynamics introduced by Bolker and Pacala. After generating a system of ordinary differential equations for the MF approximation with unspecified parameters – including birth, death, migration, and competition dynamics – we find the equilibrium points using MATHEMATICA. We then use the eigenvalue method to classify the stability of these equilibria and determine under what conditions on the given parameters, the population equilibria are stable and unstable.
